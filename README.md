# Engineering Technology

This course provides a general introduction to the fundamental technical concepts needed to understand the design and engineering of electronic, mechatronic, networked and software systems. Experience is gained in basic engineering practice, with assembly and testing of basic hardware, software and networked systems, and construction of a personal computer.

## Course Content

It is intended to give students experience in basic engineering practice, through gaining understanding of basic software and hardware systems and applying this knowledge to complete a project which includes all aspects of these technologies.

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental principles underlying Engineering, especially electronic, mechatronic, networked and software systems.
2. Work within a team, including breaking up and allocating tasks, managing a team, and working with other people to achieve a defined task.
3. Communicate through explaining what they have done in coursework and reasons for it with their peers and others.
4. Understand the role of engineers and their responsibility to society.
5. Be creative and able to apply critical thinking through the design, implementation and testing of systems to solve real-world problems.
