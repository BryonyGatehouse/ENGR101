QUADRANT 2

Follow a curvy white line

FOLLOW A LINE

Using the color difference between the black tabletop and the white line
the robot controls it's two motors so the line stays in the middle

Uses a complex algorithm to control the motors

RESULTS

While a straight line was fairly easy, some of the larger curves proved 
difficult. Through testing, the correct ratio was finally found. Another
variable, the camera position, was also changed from the intial position, 
as a low angled position provided a smoother and more accurate journey.
