# Autonomous Vechile Challenge (AVC) Project

In groups of 4-5 people, we were tasked to develop and construct an autonomous 
vehicle capable of finding it's way through a pre-determined maze without 
human assistance. The time limit was small, the budget was tiny, and the rules 
were non-negotiable. It was designed to replicate a real-world experience and 
teach students to work in teams. 

## Results

Due to sickness spreading round the teammates and time constraits, the code for
the last Quadrant wasn't finished before the deadline. This meant the team only
recieved 83% for the maze. 
Another 3% was lost due to messy wires and no switches. 

## Report

After finishing the vehicle, each member had to write a seperate report based 
on the AVC Project. This report had to be structured like an Engineering Report.
