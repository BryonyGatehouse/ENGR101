QUADRANT 1 

The vehicle follows a straight line forwards, wirelessly opens a gate, and
moves through

OPENING THE GATE

The robot has to send a "Please" request to the server (gate) which sends
a password which needs to be reflected back to open the gate

FOLLOWING A STRAIGHT LINE

Uses the same algorithm as Quadrant 2 (described in Quadrant 2)

RESULTS

Vehicle constantly proved (once the line algorithm was completed) that it 
could pass through the gate
