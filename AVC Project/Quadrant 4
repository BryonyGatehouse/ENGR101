QUADRANT 4

No more white line. Instead complete a maze with walls 100 mm tall (and 
no loops)

COMPLETE MAZE

Uses sensors to tell distance between walls and controls motors to stay in
middle. Sticks to one wall as there are no loops. 

RESULTS

This part wasn't completed properly. The vehicle could only travel a little 
way down the first maze corridor before it started tending towards one side.
With a nudge, it made it to the first corner, but couldn't make it completely
round. No more nudges were attempted (it was assumed that the vehicle wouldn't
make it far enough down the maze to be worth more points)
