AVC (Autonomous Vehicle Challenge) PROJECT

In groups of 4-5 people, we were tasked to develop and construct an autonomous 
vehicle capable of finding it's way through a pre-determined maze without 
human assistance. The time limit was small, the budget was tiny, and the rules 
were non-negotiable. It was designed to replicate a real-world experience and 
teach students to work in teams. 

RESULTS

Due to sickness spreading round the teammates and time constraits, the code for
the last Quadrant wasn't finished before the deadline. This meant the team only
recieved 83% for the maze. 
Another 3% was lost due to messy wires and no switches.
