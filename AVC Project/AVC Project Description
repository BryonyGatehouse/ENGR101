AVC (Autonomous Vehicle Challenge) PROJECT

In groups of 4-5 people, we were tasked to develop and construct an autonomous 
vehicle capable of finding it's way through a pre-determined maze without 
human assistance. The time limit was small, the budget was tiny, and the rules 
were non-negotiable. It was designed to replicate a real-world experience and 
teach students to work in teams.
